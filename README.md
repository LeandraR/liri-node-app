Using Node.js with various packages (Twitter, Spotify, Requests, DotEnv), created a 'Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface' (LIRI).
Can handle four commands:
`my-tweets`: displays the last 20 tweets from an account

`spotify-this-song`: takes in user input of song title and provides information through the Spotify API.

`movie-this`: takes in user input of movie title and provides information using the OMDb API.

`do-what-it-says`: provides song information.
